1. How do you access the fourth element of an array or slice?  
You access the fourth element of an array or slice with: arr[3]  
2. What is the length of a slice created using make([]int, 3, 9)?  
The length of the slice is 3.  
3. Given the following array, what would x[2:5] give you?  
````golang
x := [6]string{"a","b","c","d","e","f"}
````
The array would give you [c,d,e].  
4. Write a program that finds the smallest number int this list:
````golang
x := []int{
    48,96,86,68,
    57,82,63,70,
    37,34,83,27,
    19,97, 9,17,
}
````
